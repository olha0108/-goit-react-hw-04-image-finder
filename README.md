Pixabay API supports pagination, by default the page parameter is set to 1. Let the response comes with 12 objects each, set to per_page. Don't Remember that when you search for a new keyword, you have to reset the value of page to 1.

The response from the api comes an array of objects in which you are only interested in the following properties.

id - a unique identifier
webformatURL - link to the small image for the list of cards
largeImageURL - link to the large image for the modal window

    < /button >

    < input

Description of the < Button > component. 

Pressing the Load more button should load the next batch of Images and rendered with the previous ones. The button should be rendered only when there are some loaded images. If the image array is empty, the button is not rendered.

When you click on a gallery item a modal window with a dark overlay and display a larger version of the image. The modal window should be closed.

The appearance is similar to the functionality of this VanillaJS-plugin, only instead of white modal window the image is rendered (in the example press Run). Animation is not required.

< div class="overlay" >
  < div class="modal" >
    < img src="" alt="" / >
  < /div >
